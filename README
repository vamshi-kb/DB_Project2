##### INTRODUCTION
----------
Project 1: Relational Algebra Operators
This project contains various operators of relational algebra implemented in Java 17. Completed for CSCI 6370 Database Management at the University of Georgia.

In the project the relational algebra operators are demonstrated on a database of movie details.
Therefore the code was given by the instructor except the operators select, project, union, minus, and join operations were to be implemented by group members.

##### REQUIREMENTS
----------

This code should run with any Java version that is installed in your system.

### JAVA 17
We are using java 17 for our project. Instructions to follow to set the environment is given in the below link.
https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html

Instruction are given for Java 1.8 but you can follow the same similar instructions to set up the Java 17 environment.

### SBT 1.6.2
Make sure to have the sbt 1.6.2 version installed in the system.

### IDEs
In order to compile the program the following IDE's can be used(Intellij, eclipse....). We have used intelliJ.

##### Build, Compilation and Running
We are using sbt for building, compilation and running project.
1) Get in the terminal in intelliJ IDE or open cmd terminal.
2) Change the directory to the project folder.
3) run sbt. This should open the sbt environment where you can compile and run the project.
4) Next run compile. This should compile the project.
5) Next run runMain MovieDB. This should run the main class i.e., MovieDB of our project and give the results out.


##### IMPLEMENTATION
----------
We had implemented five Relational algebra operators on the database, they are
	1.project
	2.Select
	3.Union
	4.Minus
	5.Join

##### CONTRIBUTORS
----------
1) Project and minus operations are coded by Likitha Karnati.
2) Select and Union operators are coded by Siva Narayana Kota
3) sbt build file, environment setup and Join operators are coded by Vamshi Bitchala.
