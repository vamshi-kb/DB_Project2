##### INTRODUCTION
----------
Project 2: Linear Hashmap indexing and RA operators optimizing
This project contains Linear hashmap indexing implementation and optimization of the various operators of relational algebra implemented in Java 17. Completed for CSCI 6370 Database Management at the University of Georgia.

We have created and commented the method calls in LinHashMap.java. The MapType mType has been changed to LinHashmap from TREE_MAP to check the optimization capability and implementation of the hash indexing.

##### REQUIREMENTS
----------
This code should run with any Java version that is installed in your system.

### JAVA 17
We are using java 17 for our project. Instructions to follow to set the environment is given in the below link.
https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html

Instruction are given for Java 1.8 but you can follow the same similar instructions to set up the Java 17 environment.

### SBT 1.6.2
Make sure to have the sbt 1.6.2 version installed in the system.

### IDEs
In order to compile the program the following IDE's can be used(Intellij, eclipse....). We have used intelliJ.

##### Build, Compilation and Running
We are using sbt for building, compilation and running project.
1) Get in the terminal in intelliJ IDE or open cmd terminal.
2) Change the directory to the project folder.
3) run sbt. This should open the sbt environment where you can compile and run the project.
4) Next run compile. This should compile the project.
5) Next run runMain MovieDB. This should run the main class i.e., MovieDB of our project and give the results out.


##### IMPLEMENTATION
----------
We had implemented Split and Set method in the LinHashMap.java and optimized the five Relational algebra operators on the database, they are
	1.project
	2.Select
	3.Union
	4.Minus
	5.Join

##### CONTRIBUTORS
----------
1) Set, Split are implemented and Join operation is optimized Vamshi Bitchala.
2) Project and minus operations are optimized by Likitha Karnati.
3) Select and Union operators are optimized by Siva Narayana Kota
